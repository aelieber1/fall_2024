This repository holds files that were made during the Fall 2024 Semester

The main projects of this semester were: 
- HC3N Vibrational Line Project for the SSCs in NGC 253
- Comparative Line Analysis from each SSC
- Creating LaTeX Tables for upcoming paper
- Creating new plots to visualize data (e.g. stacked line plot)
- Small analysis/conversion scripts to help in the analysis of spectra

These files were copied in December 2024 at their stage at that point. They may have been updated since then.
